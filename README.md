# characterControllers
Multiple test examples of character controllers for Unity. I am going to put all sorts of character controllers (including cars, enemies, weapons, and other program scripts in it).

FILES INCLUDED-

/- character controller.cs 
  This Script can turn the character's faces right or left according to the movement script, move left and right, and jump. The special thing in this script is the double jump.
